This error occurs when you try to use a feature or module in Expo Go or a standalone app built with Expo that isn't supported by the current version of Expo Go or the Expo SDK.  For instance, using a new React Native feature or a third-party library that hasn't been fully integrated with Expo's build system can cause this. The exact error message might vary but will generally indicate that the requested module is not found or not available.
