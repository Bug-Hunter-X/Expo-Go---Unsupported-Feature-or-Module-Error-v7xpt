This solution focuses on identifying and addressing unsupported modules. There's no single fix, as it depends on the specific unsupported feature.

**Strategies:**

1. **Use an Expo-compatible alternative:**  Check for Expo-compatible libraries or features that provide similar functionality. The Expo documentation and community forums can help identify appropriate alternatives.

2. **Upgrade the Expo SDK:** Update to the latest Expo SDK version.  Newer versions often include wider support for new features and modules.

3. **Eject from Expo (if necessary and possible):**  If the unsupported feature is crucial and upgrading isn't an option, consider ejecting from Expo to gain full control over the underlying React Native project.  This involves complexities and should be used as a last resort.

4. **Wait for support:** Some cutting-edge features might not yet be officially supported by Expo. In this case, you might need to wait for future updates or check the Expo roadmap.
